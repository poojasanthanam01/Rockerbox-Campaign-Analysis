# 📊 Rockerbox-Campaign-Analysis

This repository showcases two data-driven case studies simulating Rockerbox’s core value proposition—measuring marketing impact and optimizing spend through incrementality testing and channel efficiency analysis.

## 📌 Overview

Using simulated user-level marketing data, I conducted:

1. **Incrementality Testing**  
   A structured experiment comparing conversion and revenue lift between a control group and users exposed to TikTok ads.

2. **Channel Efficiency Optimization**  
   A performance comparison across four marketing channels—Instagram, Google, TikTok, and Email—to identify high-ROI channels and optimize budget allocation.
